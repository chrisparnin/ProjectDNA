The gain may vary, but even the optimized JavaScript libraries like Box2D becomes faster when ported to JSX (12% faster on iOS 5.1, 29% faster on Android 2.3). \n*safer: In contrast to JavaScript, JSX is statically-typed and mostly type-safe. The quality of applications becomes higher when being developed using JSX, since many errors will be caught during the compilation process. It also offers debugging features at the compiler level as well. \n*easier: JSX offers a solid class system much like the Java programming language, freeing the developers from working with the too-primitive prototype-based inheritance system provided by JavaScript.
